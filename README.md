#Accordion

Display only the most important information.

The Accordion App is a great way to list out high level information while keeping the bulk of the content hidden. If a user wants more information each item can be expanded or stretched to reveal more content by clicking on the plus (+) sign.  If theyâ€™d like to hide the expanded section they can click the minus (-) sign.

The Accordion app allows a website to contain a lot of content but keeps the design neat and clean by only showing small snippets of information. Choose from multiple styles such as standard, minimal, 3D, and boxed.
